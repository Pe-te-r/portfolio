        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>As a developer, I wanted to explore how different frameworks handle the same task. I decided to build a simple API for managing users and posts using Hono, Express, and Flask.</p>
  
        <h2>Hono</h2>
        <p>Hono is a lightweight and fast framework for building APIs. I was impressed by its simplicity and performance. Here's how I built the API:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Easy setup with Bun.</li>
          <li>Minimal boilerplate code.</li>
          <li>Great for edge computing.</li>
        </ul>
  
        <h2>Express</h2>
        <p>Express is a popular Node.js framework. It's well-documented and has a large community. My experience:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Lots of middleware options.</li>
          <li>Easy to integrate with databases.</li>
          <li>Great for beginners.</li>
        </ul>
  
        <h2>Flask</h2>
        <p>Flask is a Python framework known for its simplicity. I enjoyed working with it because of its flexibility. Highlights:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Lightweight and easy to learn.</li>
          <li>Great for small to medium projects.</li>
          <li>Integrates well with Python libraries.</li>
        </ul>
  
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Each framework has its strengths. Hono is great for edge computing, Express is perfect for Node.js developers, and Flask is ideal for Python enthusiasts. I plan to explore more frameworks like FastAPI and NestJS in the future!</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>After exploring Hono, Express, and Flask, I'm excited to dive into FastAPI and NestJS. Here's what I plan to do:</p>
  
        <h2>FastAPI</h2>
        <p>FastAPI is a modern Python framework known for its speed and automatic documentation. My goals:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Build the same user and post API.</li>
          <li>Explore its async capabilities.</li>
          <li>Test its performance.</li>
        </ul>
  
        <h2>NestJS</h2>
        <p>NestJS is a TypeScript framework inspired by Angular. I'm curious about its modular architecture. Plans:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Build the API using TypeScript.</li>
          <li>Explore its dependency injection system.</li>
          <li>Compare it with Express.</li>
        </ul>
  
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>I'm excited to share my experiences with these frameworks soon. Stay tuned!</p>
